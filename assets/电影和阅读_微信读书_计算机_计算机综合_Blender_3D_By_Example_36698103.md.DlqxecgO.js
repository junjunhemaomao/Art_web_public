With this book, you&#39;ll learn about modeling, rigging, animation, rendering, and much more with the help of some interesting projects.This practical guide, based on the Blender 2.83 LTS version, starts by helping you brush up on your basic Blender skills and getting you acquainted with the software toolset. You’ll use basic modeling tools to understand the simplest 3D workflow by customizing a Viking themed scene. You&#39;ll get a chance to see the 3D modeling process from start to finish by building a time machine based on provided concept art. You will design your first 2D character while exploring the capabilities of the new Grease Pencil tools. The book then guides you in creating a sleek modern kitchen scene using EEVEE, Blender’s new state-of-the-art rendering engine. As you advance, you&#39;ll explore a variety of 3D design techniques, such as sculpting, retopologizing, unwrapping, baking, painting, rigging, and animating to bring a baby dragon to life.By the end of this book, you&#39;ll have learned how to work with Blender to create impressive computer graphics, art, design, and architecture, and you&#39;ll be able to use robust Blender tools for your design projects and video games.</li><li><strong>出版时间</strong>： 2020-05-29 00:00:00</li><li><strong>ISBN</strong>： 9781789617993</li><li><strong>分类</strong>： 计算机-计算机综合</li><li><strong>出版社</strong>： Packt Publishing</li><li><strong>PC地址</strong>： <a href="https://weread.qq.com/web/reader/d8d32460722ff7f7d8d97fd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://weread.qq.com/web/reader/d8d32460722ff7f7d8d97fd</a></li></ul><h4 id="the-principled-bsdf-material" tabindex="-1">The Principled BSDF material <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-principled-bsdf-material" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Principled BSDF material&quot;">​</a></h4><blockquote><p>📌 Almost every item in the kitchen will use the Principled BSDF material, and to make successful materials, we need to understand the science and practice of physically-based materials. BSDF (short for Bi-directional Scatter Distribution Falloff). When an emission of light hits a surface, there&#39;s a limited number of plausible physical effects. First, the light ray is an emission. That ray can reflect off the surface, bouncing back light&#39;s energy. The ray can scatter through the surface, partially getting absorbed, and partially bouncing that light back out as diffuse reflections, also called albedo. The part of this scattered ray that sends out the remaining light is characterized by the energy that wasn&#39;t absorbed, as seen in the base color. When the light can scatter deeper in and back out of a surface, like a candle flame visible through the wax, it&#39;s called subsurface scattering. But the light ray might never reflect, having transmission through a surface, going straight through, and continuing on the other side. This transmission through the shader can slow the light ray, changing its angle, known as refraction. We can visualize many of these properties with the following screenshot: ⏱ 2021-08-22 01:02:07</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>📌 The ray can scatter through the surface, partially getting absorbed, and partially bouncing that light back out as diffuse reflections, also called albedo.</p></blockquote><ul><li>💭 除了被吸收的光线，部分被反射的光线(进入我们眼睛的可辨识光线),叫做albedo - ⏱ 2021-08-22 00:54:06</li></ul><blockquote><p>📌 When the light can scatter deeper in and back out of a surface, like a candle flame visible through the wax, it&#39;s called subsurface scattering.
