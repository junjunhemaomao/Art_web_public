Does the arm move and rotate? Repeat for the right arm. Don’t forget the group node over the IK handle. I’ll wait. What would happen if you didn’t have the group node? Any student from my frst few years of rigging would know. I even saw the same issue in a Digital Tutor rig: when you moved the controller back to zero—the IK handle wouldn’t snap back until you jiggled the controller: slightly annoying. On a lark I threw in a group node to see what would happen. Aha! Fixed it. In newer versions of Maya, this seems to not be the case. I’ll keep the fx here just in case. Use or don’t use. Up to you.</li></ol><p>Waist Control</p><p>To create a control that moves the skeleton of the character up and down is simple:1. Create a control: FDH (freeze, delete history); label it Hip_CNTRL.2. Place the controller at the bottom of the character.3. Make sure the pivotis on the Spine1 joint.4. Select the Hip_CNTRLand the Spine1 joint (in that order!)5. Create a Parent Constraint.Test: Te Hip_CNTRL should move and rotate the character’s spine. Te arms will stay behind with their IK handles. Tis is expected. IK arms do not move with the body unless we use another controller, which we’ll create next.</p><p>Main Move for the Character</p><p>We’ll create a controller that moves the whole character, including the IK arms. Refer to Figure 5.10.1. Create a controller, FDH.</p><blockquote><p>⏱ 2023-03-13 09:24:35</p></blockquote><h3 id="chapter-6-blendshapes-and-set-driven-key" tabindex="-1">Chapter 6: Blendshapes and Set Driven Key <a class="header-anchor" href="#chapter-6-blendshapes-and-set-driven-key" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Chapter 6: Blendshapes and Set Driven Key&quot;">​</a></h3><blockquote><p>📌 Tese virtual sliders adjust from 0 to 1 to turn the blendshapes on and of. You can click the edit button on any one blendshape and continue to edit it.Just as a side note, you can also type in numbers bigger than 1 and the blendshape will continue to adjust the vertices based on the original way that they were being moved. Tis can be a good thing to give the animator, when you put a controller onto these attributes. Perhaps they might want to push the blendshape just a little bit further than what was created.If you need to adjust the geometry, even after you have made the blendshapes and connected them, you can. For example, if you add in a nose by extruding a face, then select the main character and go to Edit&gt;Delete by Type&gt;Non-Deformer History, which will delete the extrude node and then fow the extrudes down into the blendshape targets automatically in newer versions of Maya (2011+).
