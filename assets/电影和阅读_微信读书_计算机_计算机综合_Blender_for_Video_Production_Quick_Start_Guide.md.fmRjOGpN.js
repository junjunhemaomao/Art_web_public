In most cases, you will find video producers using software that can only cut and mount video in a &quot;traditional&quot; way. What if you could use a software that offers not only options to edit and cut video, but also create 3D content and animation? With Blender, you can make use of a fantastic set of tools to edit and cut video, and also produce 3D content that will enable you to take your productions to the next level.Do you want to take footage from a camera and cut or add sound and titles? This book will show you how Blender can do that for you! You will learn to add 3D virtual objects to the same footage that will help you to create a full 3D environment. Using some camera tricks, you can even turn Blender into a powerful 2.5D animation software to create compelling infographics to produce educational, marketing, and instructional videos. You will also learn how to work with motion tracking to mix live-action footage with virtual objects. You will then learn how to use the video editing capabilities of Blender and match 3D content to your project for YouTube or any other media.Toward the end of the book, you will export the project to YouTube using optimal settings for the best performance in the platform.</li><li><strong>出版时间</strong>： 2018-11-30 00:00:00</li><li><strong>ISBN</strong>： 9781789809657</li><li><strong>分类</strong>： 计算机-计算机综合</li><li><strong>出版社</strong>： Packt Publishing</li><li><strong>PC地址</strong>： <a href="https://weread.qq.com/web/reader/14632c10722ffbf61463f3a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://weread.qq.com/web/reader/14632c10722ffbf61463f3a</a></li></ul><h2 id="preface" tabindex="-1">Preface <a class="header-anchor" href="#preface" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Preface&quot;">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>📌 Among all those hidden features of Blender, you will find a non-linear video editor. ⏱ 2021-08-20 01:50:01</p></blockquote><h2 id="blender-as-a-video-editor-for-youtube" tabindex="-1">Blender as a Video Editor for YouTube <a class="header-anchor" href="#blender-as-a-video-editor-for-youtube" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Blender as a Video Editor for YouTube&quot;">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>📌 all types of video-related material ⏱ 2021-08-20 01:54:29</p></blockquote><h3 id="using-blender-as-a-video-editor" tabindex="-1">Using Blender as a video editor <a class="header-anchor" href="#using-blender-as-a-video-editor" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Using Blender as a video editor&quot;">​</a></h3><blockquote><p>📌 Blender&#39;s developers wanted to create a tool that could handle all aspects of media production. ⏱ 2021-08-20 02:01:05</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>📌 3D content creation that will result in a video file ⏱ 2021-08-20 02:03:21</p></blockquote><h4 id="the-blender-video-sequencer-and-workspaces" tabindex="-1">The Blender Video Sequencer and workspaces <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-blender-video-sequencer-and-workspaces" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Blender Video Sequencer and workspaces&quot;">​</a></h4><blockquote><p>📌 Video Sequencer ⏱ 2021-08-20 02:11:21</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>📌 To have a fluid preview in real time, you must use a powerful computer that can handle massive video editing processing. ⏱ 2021-08-20 14:31:46</p></blockquote><h3 id="summary" tabindex="-1">Summary <a class="header-anchor" href="#summary" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Summary&quot;">​</a></h3><blockquote><p>📌 how to import and add footage to the Video Sequence Editor in Blender. ⏱ 2021-08-20 01:25:33</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>📌 The next step is to go even further by editing and rearranging strips any way you want.
