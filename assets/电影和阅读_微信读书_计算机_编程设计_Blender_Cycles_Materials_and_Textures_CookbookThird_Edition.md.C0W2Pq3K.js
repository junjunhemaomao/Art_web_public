This control isn&#39;t that much precise, by the way, and will hopefully improve in the future. The next steps are as follows ⏱ 2021-09-05 03:45:19</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>📌 and actually, the Generated coordinates output is used by default ⏱ 2021-09-05 03:16:48</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>📌 A different way to render the two objects on a uniform blue background is to use a Light Path node: ⏱ 2021-09-05 03:31:33</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>📌 The objects in the scene are lit by the HDR image connected to the first Background node, but they appear in a sky that is colored as set in the Color box of the second Background node. ⏱ 2021-09-05 03:42:27</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>📌 The use of the Path Light node as a factor to have a different background than the HDR image still illuminating the scene ⏱ 2021-09-05 03:43:37</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>📌 the Mix Shader node.

The Glossy or Transmission BSDF components are not affected. ⏱ 2021-09-05 03:55:50</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>📌 a half-transparent surface will only half-occlude other surfaces ⏱ 2021-09-05 03:56:50</p></blockquote><h3 id="creating-a-mesh-light-material" tabindex="-1">Creating a mesh-light material <a class="header-anchor" href="#creating-a-mesh-light-material" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Creating a mesh-light material&quot;">​</a></h3><blockquote><p>📌 any mesh object and used as a source to light the scene. ⏱ 2021-09-05 04:07:10</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>📌 t uses a material created by connecting an Emission node to the Lamp Output node. ⏱ 2021-09-05 04:04:55</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>📌 we can assign an Emission shader to a mesh, ⏱ 2021-09-05 04:06:52</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>📌 Light emission coming from a surface and not from a point is a lot more diffused and softer than the light from a Lamp. ⏱ 2021-09-05 04:11:03</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>📌 for example, a table lamp, or a neon sign, or a television screen. ⏱ 2021-09-05 04:12:17</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>📌 Uncheck the Camera item and watch the Emitter plane disappear in the rendered 3D window, but the scene still lit by it ⏱ 2021-09-05 20:34:40</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>📌 when the Camera box is unchecked, the mesh-light won&#39;t be rendered but it will still emit light. Be careful that the Emitter plane is not renderable at this moment, but because all the other items in the tab are still checked, it can be reflected and could cast its own shadow on other objects. ⏱ 2021-09-05 20:34:40</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>📌 when the Camera box is unchecked, the mesh-light won&#39;t be rendered but it will still emit light. ⏱ 2021-09-05 20:34:38</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>📌 switch the Diffuse BSDF shader with a Glossy BSDF shader.
