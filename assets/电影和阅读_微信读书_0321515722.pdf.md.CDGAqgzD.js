FIGURE 1.3 A graphical user interface, or GUI, can be added to the iconic rig to enhance the character controls. [插图] This book will take you through the process of creating both kinds of inter- faces as a part of scripting the advanced rig. You will begin by building the iconic controls in the Maya interface, and then automate the same rigging process entirely through MEL scripting. Throughout this process you will use a simple scripted GUI to more easily run your rigging scripts. Once the rig is complete, you will be shown how to create an advanced character animation GUI that can be used in conjunction with the iconic controls. Character Rigging in a 3D Production Rigging is one of the main components of any 3D character animation, and falls roughly in the middle of the production process before animation.
