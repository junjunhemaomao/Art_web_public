Unity has become a top choice for developers looking to create these kinds of immersive RPGs.Building an RPG with Unity 2018, based on building some of the most common RPG features, teaches you tips, tricks, and techniques that can be applied to your own game.To start with, the book guides you through the fundamentals of role-playing games. You will learn the necessary aspects of building an RPG, such as structuring the game environment, customizing characters, controlling the camera, and designing other attributes such as inventory and weapons. You will also explore designing game levels by adding more features. Once you have understood the bigger picture, you will understand how to tackle the obstacles of networking in Unity and implement multiplayer mode for your RPG games.By the end of the book, you will be able to build upon the core RPG framework elements to create your own immersive games.</li><li><strong>出版时间</strong>： 2018-07-30 00:00:00</li><li><strong>ISBN</strong>： 9781788626996</li><li><strong>分类</strong>： 计算机-编程设计</li><li><strong>出版社</strong>： Packt Publishing</li><li><strong>PC地址</strong>： <a href="https://weread.qq.com/web/reader/7fb32d50722ffde27fbe12e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://weread.qq.com/web/reader/7fb32d50722ffde27fbe12e</a></li></ul><h3 id="characteristics-of-an-rpg" tabindex="-1">Characteristics of an RPG <a class="header-anchor" href="#characteristics-of-an-rpg" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Characteristics of an RPG&quot;">​</a></h3><blockquote><p>📌 such events throughout the game.The key elements of an RPG are as follows:Story and settingExploration and questsItems and inventoryCharacter actions and abilitiesExperience and levelsCombatInterface and graphics ⏱ 2023-08-16 19:40:57</p></blockquote><h4 id="story-and-setting" tabindex="-1">Story and setting <a class="header-anchor" href="#story-and-setting" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Story and setting&quot;">​</a></h4><blockquote><p>📌 This is usually done by introducing new characters and/or areas to discover within an existing level. ⏱ 2023-08-16 19:40:42</p></blockquote><h4 id="exploration-and-quests" tabindex="-1">Exploration and quests <a class="header-anchor" href="#exploration-and-quests" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Exploration and quests&quot;">​</a></h4><blockquote><p>📌 But generally speaking, this is not done by the player; once they meet their objective, they are eager to move on to the next quest.
