Assassin (アサシン, Asashin?), is the Assassin-class Servant of Medea in the Fifth Holy Grail War of Fate/stay night. He is an irregular Servant that shouldn't exist according to the rules of the Holy Grail War, but Medea's unique nature as a Servant summoning a Servant twists the process. The true Servant, one of the Hassan-i-Sabbah, is summoned as True Assassin in the Heaven's Feel route.
He is one of the Servants summoned by Ritsuka Fujimaru in the Grand Orders conflicts of Fate/Grand Order, appearing as both his Assassin-class self and as a Saber-class Servant, Nameless Saber (セイバー・無銘, Seibā Mumei?), during his duel with Miyamoto Musashi.

He is the Servant of Makki in the world "After" the Holy Grail War in Fate/Requiem under the alias of Tsuda (津田?).
